# The Field of Data Science - The Various Data Science Disciplines

## Analysis vs Analytics
Analysis is separating a large data set into smaller parts, studying them individually, and examining how they relate to each other. This is performed on things that have already happened in the past. Analysis is to explain how and/or why something happened.

Analytics generally refers to the future. Instead of explaining past events, it explores potential future ones. Analytics is essentially the application of logical and computational reasoning to the component parts obtained in an analysis, and in doing this, you are looking for patterns and exploring what you can do with them in the future. 

Analytics breaks off into two areas:

1. Qualitative
    - Using your intuition and experience in conjunction with the analysis to plan your next business move
2.  Quantitative
    - Applying formulas and algorithms to numbers you've gathered from your analysis

They're not completely independent of each other. For example, you can use qualitative analysis to explain how or why a story ended the way it did, and perform quantitative analysis working with past data to explain how sales decrease last summer.

## Business Analytics, Data Analytics, and Data Science: An Introduction

- Data science is a discipline reliant on data availability, while business analytics does not completely rely on data
- DS incorporates part of data analytics, mostly the part that uses complex mathematical, statistical, and programming tools
- DS can be used to improve the accuracy of predictions based on data extracted from various activities typical for drilling efficiency
- Digital signal is used to represent data in the form of discrete values which is an example of numeric data. Therefore, data analytics can be applied to digital signal in order to produce a higher quality signal
