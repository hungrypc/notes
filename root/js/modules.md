# Modules in JS

We don't necessarily have just one massive js file, ideally our code is broken up into different files with different functionality. So we need a way to import dependencies and export functionality (often called an interface) to allow others to use our code. With modules, this idea extends beyond just functions and classes. 

The way we structure data should be the most important part of our program because it's going to allow us to have more maintainable code.
