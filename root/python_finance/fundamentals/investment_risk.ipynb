    "A volatile stock market is much more likely to deviate from its historical returns and surprise investors negatively.

Investors are risk averse. \n",

    "The most obvious example is the development of the economu in general favorable macro-economic conditions. facilitate the business of all companies. When people ahve jobs and money in their pockets, they will spend more. Companies benefit from that as their revenue increases. (And vice versa). Whenever the economy is doing good, stock prices are higher. In times of recession, companies profits are lower and share prices fall significantly. Shares are influenced by the state of the economy.  \n",

    "However, different industries are influenced in a different way. Eg, in a time of crisis, car makers would do worse than supermarket chains. \n",

    "Say you have shares in Facebook and have extra savings to invest in another company. Would you pick LinkedIn or Walmart? The right answer is Walmart. If anything goes wrong in the tech space, you would be somewhat protected since it will not suffer from the potentially negative development in tech. Same is valid for the retail sector. Buying shares in the same industry would expose you to excessive risk."
