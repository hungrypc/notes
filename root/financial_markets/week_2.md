## Invention Takes Time

Story of how the suitcase was invented -> It wasn't what it is now in its original form, it took 10 years for the suitcase to evolve into what it is now (originally with wheels and a leather strap, later improved on with better wheels and the rigid handle).

Gist of the lecture: financial theory is transforming and will continue to transform.

## Salong - Invention

Financial innovation is a sequence of inventions that incentivize people, provide capital for enterprises. Part of financial innovation is reframing risk so that they're appealing. We want to also, for good social purpose to be risks that need to be taken - so that they benefit the economy.

## Limited Liability

Though NY state can be creditted with inventing the full dimension of this idea in 1811, it precedes 1811.

>The idea is that investors, in order to be encouraged to invest in businesses, should have protection against liability for what the managers of the business do.

In 1811, New York state passed a law that said investors in stocks can never be pursued for the mistakes of the company invested in. You could buy shares in businesses but you are only liable for what you put in intially. Before this, there was doubt about that - the idea of going after shareholders for the sins of a company was rare, but people had to worry that this could happen. At first, people thought that this was crazy, Massachusetts passed a law around the same time that reaffirmed that shareholders are responsible for what they invest in and said that you are party to the crime. Because of this, almost all the business went to New York and NY become the mecca for business. Eventually, state by state, they all passed limited liability laws.

You can lose what you put in, but you know exactly what you put in. Investor psychology favors limited liability. David Moss posited that limited liability created sort of a lottery effect. You could invest in some enterprise just for fun.

The other thing about limited liability is that it created the whole idea of holding a diversified portfolio. And we know that ther is risk management power in the diversification.

## Inflation Indexed Debt

We've always traditionally borrowed money in debt contracts and promised to pay them back in the currency. But there are so many examples where the currency is unstable. So the idea is, why don't we have a price index and have a debt contract that pays back index to inflation? Then it's fixed in real terms. The history of it, however, is very slow to get going.

The first index debt was invented in the US in 1780, which occured because of inflation. The US gov was giving debt to the soldiers during the revolutionary war, denominated in currency that as issued then by state government. And they debase the currency because of the war, it was rapid inflation. The soldiers were really unhappy because what they got was already worthless before they got it. So, in order to keep the soldiers happy, this was a necessity. They decided to define a consumer price index. And the bond had to pay out in inflation-indexed terms. But there was a lot of other people who were paid in nominal debts. There was actually a rebellion called Shays' rebellion about the unfairness of this debt. So, somehow the US gov didn't issue them again. Now, the US does, and it's spread around the world.

## Unidad de Fomento

In 1967, Chile was going through a hyperinflation. Prices were going up something like 1000% a year. People were distressed about it. So now, the idea that Chile invested then was to create a enw unit of account. In Spanish, unidad de fomento means unit of development.

Money has several functions, it's a store value, a unit of acocunt, and a means of transactions. You can separate out those functions - you can have a separate unit of account that is not money. So they invented a Unidad de Fomento, and they allowed its value to be tied to the Consumer Price Index. They would publish in Chilean newspapers every day the exchange rate between the currency and the UF.

## Real Estate: Risk Management Devices

Values of homes goes up and down a lot, and people are not protected against these fluctuations. You can short a merket for homes to protect yourself against a collapse. If you buy a house for 500k, you borrow 450k, the price of the house falls to 400k, you are now 50k underwater. You go to you mortgage lender and say "I'm underwater, what do we do?" and the mortgage lender will typically say "tough luck, we'll sue you and come after you if you don't pay." Why do we leave it like this? Because progress is slow.

Most of our risks are still not managed well.

## Forecasting

Efficient Markets Hypothesis. The history of the hypothesis, reasons to think that markets are efficient, and reasons to doubt it. People tend to think that something they saw in the past is representative of what will happen in the future.

The random walk theory is a process that changes in such a way that each change is independent of previous changes and totally unforecastable. In 1973, the idea coming out then was that stock market prices are really random walks, you shouldn't try to forecast it and should just hold a diversified portfolio.

An alternative to a random walk model is a first-order autoregressive model (AR-1). (elastic band tugging it back to a normal level)
