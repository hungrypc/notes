# Financial Markets W2

## Invention Takes Time

Story of how the suitcase was invented -> It wasn't what it is now in its original form, it took 10 years for the suitcase to evolve into what it is now (originally with wheels and a leather strap, later improved on with better wheels and the rigid handle).

Gist of the lecture: financial theory is transforming and will continue to transform.

## Salong - Invention

Financial innovation is a sequence of inventions that incentivize people, provide capital for enterprises. Part of financial innovation is reframing risk so that they're appealing. We want to also, for good social purpose to be risks that need to be taken - so that they benefit the economy.

## Limited Liability

Though NY state can be creditted with inventing the full dimension of this idea in 1811, it precedes 1811.

>The idea is that investors, in order to be encouraged to invest in businesses, should have protection against liability for what the managers of the business do.

In 1811, New York state passed a law that said investors in stocks can never be pursued for the mistakes of the company invested in. You could buy shares in businesses but you are only liable for what you put in intially. Before this, there was doubt about that - the idea of going after shareholders for the sins of a company was rare, but people had to worry that this could happen. At first, people thought that this was crazy, Massachusetts passed a law around the same time that reaffirmed that shareholders are responsible for what they invest in and said that you are party to the crime. Because of this, almost all the business went to New York and NY become the mecca for business. Eventually, state by state, they all passed limited liability laws.

You can lose what you put in, but you know exactly what you put in. Investor psychology favors limited liability. David Moss posited that limited liability created sort of a lottery effect. You could invest in some enterprise just for fun.

The other thing about limited liability is that it created the whole idea of holding a diversified portfolio. And we know that ther is risk management power in the diversification.

## Inflation Indexed Debt

We've always traditionally borrowed money in debt contracts and promised to pay them back in the currency. But there are so many examples where the currency is unstable. So the idea is, why don't we have a price index and have a debt contract that pays back index to inflation? Then it's fixed in real terms. The history of it, however, is very slow to get going.

The first index debt was invented in the US in 1780, which occured because of inflation. The US gov was giving debt to the soldiers during the revolutionary war, denominated in currency that as issued then by state government. And they debase the currency because of the war, it was rapid inflation. The soldiers were really unhappy because what they got was already worthless before they got it. So, in order to keep the soldiers happy, this was a necessity. They decided to define a consumer price index. And the bond had to pay out in inflation-indexed terms. But there was a lot of other people who were paid in nominal debts. There was actually a rebellion called Shays' rebellion about the unfairness of this debt. So, somehow the US gov didn't issue them again. Now, the US does, and it's spread around the world.

## Unidad de Fomento

In 1967, Chile was going through a hyperinflation. Prices were going up something like 1000% a year. People were distressed about it. So now, the idea that Chile invested then was to create a enw unit of account. In Spanish, unidad de fomento means unit of development.

Money has several functions, it's a store value, a unit of acocunt, and a means of transactions. You can separate out those functions - you can have a separate unit of account that is not money. So they invented a Unidad de Fomento, and they allowed its value to be tied to the Consumer Price Index. They would publish in Chilean newspapers every day the exchange rate between the currency and the UF.

## Real Estate: Risk Management Devices

Values of homes goes up and down a lot, and people are not protected against these fluctuations. You can short a merket for homes to protect yourself against a collapse. If you buy a house for 500k, you borrow 450k, the price of the house falls to 400k, you are now 50k underwater. You go to you mortgage lender and say "I'm underwater, what do we do?" and the mortgage lender will typically say "tough luck, we'll sue you and come after you if you don't pay." Why do we leave it like this? Because progress is slow.

Most of our risks are still not managed well.

## Forecasting

Efficient Markets Hypothesis. The history of the hypothesis, reasons to think that markets are efficient, and reasons to doubt it. People tend to think that something they saw in the past is representative of what will happen in the future.

The random walk theory is a process that changes in such a way that each change is independent of previous changes and totally unforecastable. In 1973, the idea coming out then was that stock market prices are really random walks, you shouldn't try to forecast it and should just hold a diversified portfolio.

An alternative to a random walk model is a first-order autoregressive model (AR-1). (elastic band tugging it back to a normal level)

## Intuition of Efficiency

The whole idea is getting information fast, and acting fast on that information. If you can't predict the market, the next best thing is to beat the market. If you read something in the news last week, it's already been incorporated into the market prices. If we didn't have the markets, we wouldn't know what anything was worth. Any business plan involves prices, and all these prices are relevant to an intelligent decision. So not only are markets efficient in terms of time, they're better knowledge than any individual because it involes so many people all putting their money on the line and trading them. And it produces values that are the best estimate of fundamental value, which then drives businesses and make decisions based on these prices. "Security prices accurately reflect the available information, and respond rapidly to new information as soon as it becomes available". This implies that competition in capital markets is very tough. This theory took a hit after the financial crisis though.

Harry Robert, the coiner of the term efficient markets, stated that there are three forms for market efficiency. Weak form is that information in past prices can't help you to forecase, semi-strong form is that all public information is already incorporated in the market prices, and the strong form is that all information, including inside information, is already incorporated in the stock prices because it leaks out.

Efficient market hypothesis was stated 50 years ago, but why is it still a hypothesis? It's useful to think of it when going into investing because of our exaggerated expectation of what we can do. It's a half truth.

## Price as PDV

Price equals earnings divided by a discount factor, which is the discount rate minue the growth rate of earnings. So price = earnings over some number. This is called the **Gordon Model**

What it implies is that unless the risk factor is different from some stock to another making for a different discount rate, the price earnings ration should be the same in every stock. So efficient market theory has to explain why some companies are priced higher relative to their earnings than others. So if your company is priced high relative to earnings, it would either have to be because it's low risk as measured by beta, so we're willing to pay more for it because it's low risk. Or would have to be that people have reason to think that their earning path the gross rate g is high.

Let's say a stock is priced 100 times its earnings. You might ask, why would anyone pay 100 times earnings for a stock? Efficient market theory would say that the market has decided either that this stock is very good, in terms of risk, or that the growth rate of the earnings of this company is going to be phenomenal. So high price-earnings ration should predict high growth rate of earnings.

## Doubting Efficiency

There are a lot of smart people investing, but a lot fo that smartness is devoted to marketing and manipulation of your psychology. Human emotions play a role. It's kind of crazy to think that these markets are perfect. The stock market has been known for almost 100 years as a leading indicator. The stock market has a tendency to fall before a recession. But there's another explanation: it causes the recession. Markets goes down and people will say that something's wrong, and when you do that with masses of people it can have that reverse causality.

## Introduction to Behavioral Finance

Adam Smith is famous for the quote of the invisible hand, that the free market is the invisible hand that's directing the economy. Prices guide profitablity. As we mature, we move from the desire for praise towards a desire for praiseworthiness. Suitable for praise, even if nobody knows it. That's very different from the usual assumption in economics, that one wants to maximize consumption.

## Prospect Theory

Coined by psychologists, they were criticizing the core theory of economics, the core theory being expected utility theory, and they're replacing it with a constructive alternative. So economic profession tends to use the idea that eeryone has a utility function, which depends on the things that they consume and it represents their hapiness. And that people in a world with no uncertainty will choose how much to buy at the market prices to maximize their utility function. And if there is uncertainty, then people use the probabilities of possible events to calculate the expected utility and the maximized expected utility.

Kahneman and Tversky (the psychologists) changed two things in expected utility theory. One, they replaced the utility function with what they called a value function. And two, they replaced the probabilityes with subjective probabilities determined by a weighting function in terms of the actual probabilities.

The utility function exhibits diminishing marginal utility everywhere. It's concaved down. but if you look at it, there's a funny kink at the origin, and they have it concave upward, not downward for losses.

What they're talking about here is how you react to an opportunity on any given day. And what they said is that on any given day, you form a regerence point for today. Utility depends on, relative to your reference point, what your gains and losses might be. But this reference point is kind of arbitrary, it's just where you see yourself today. This is the idea which they proposed, instead of utility, based on experimental evidence.

The origin moves through time, you're not consistent through time. If I get more money, then I move my reference point up to more money for the next choice I make. If I have less money, I move it back. That doesn't happen with utility.

What they're saying is that it's subjective, I'm always thinking relative to where I am now. What it means is that, one implication of this is people will not take small bets.

The other thing is that this curves up for losses. What that means there's a risk preference for losses. The key idea here is that people are willing to take big risks to escape loses. So people have a tendency to take risks in the domain of losses to try to get them back, that's the value function.

Another thing is the weighting function. If people were compltely rational, they would use the actualy probabilities in their calculations, but they do not actually behave completely like that. They tend to tranform their weighting function, so it looks like a curve with a slope less than one. Similarly, on the upper end, if something has a very high probability, people don't accept the hype, they don't take the probability into account, and they round it to one.

People don't take full account of the differences in probabilities of events. They tend to blur them a little, so that's prospect theory. People are overly focused on little gains and losses.

So part of prospect theory is is an experimentally based set of knowledge about mistakes that people make. It's good to learn about prospect theory to help avoid making these kind of mistakes.

The key motivation in developing prospect theory: Psychology experiments do not align with the assumptions of traditional economics. In particular, people have a skewed representation of probability, and they do not treat gains and losses equivalently.

## Chalk Talk - More on Prospect Theory

The key assumption of much economics that represents people as ration and calculating in a sensible way. The psychologists who proposed this theory said that people are a little bit rational, but it looks a little screwy what people do actually. The thing that it takes off from is the economist's idea that people are maximizers, but what is it that we maximize? Economists say utility. But they also recognize that you don't know the outcome before you make your decision, so it's random. So we have to say expected utility. This is traditional economists, I know what I want, and I am very consistent in pursuing that under uncertainty. But Kahneman and Tversky said that people don't actually always do that.

Flip a coin, I win I get $100, you win you get $200. Would you do it? The rational answer from expected utility is that you should take it because it has positive expected value. But the psychologists say that people have a value function. You're looking at your happiness and you're thinking, 200 only gives me a little happiness but losing 100 gives me a lot of unhappiness, so you won't do it. This is the kink. In Prospect Theory, there's always a kink where you are now. The kink moves with you, it's always there. At any point of time, you're always worrying about losses. But this is irrational. This is called loss aversion.

## Logical Fallacies

Most people think that they're above average. Wishful thinking is a term that people overestimate the probability of the things that they identify with and want to see happen. This wishful thinking bias also helps explain the immense volume of trade in financial markets. Why would people need to change their holdings so often?

THere's also a tendency for overconfidence in friends and leaders. People in business are also overly influenced by the random successes of themselves or others.

Cognitive dissonance refers to the mental conflict that occurs when one's beliegs are discovered to be wrong. Once you've made a decision, you kind of identify with that decision and it's me. Now I want to hear more about why I was right. I don't want to hear that I might be wrong. It's a personal thing.

Goetzmann and Peles looked at mutual fund investors and found evidence for cognitive dissonance. They also found that when they talked to investors, they didn't remember the performance of funds that had declined. Human thought has a tendency to blank out bad memories of times when you were wrong, and don't even know that they happen. We have a system that protects us against our own psychological failings.

## The Brain

Shefrin and Thaler (economists) said that people don't look at the whole portfolio the way capital asset pricing model assumed. The theory says that you shouldn't care about what your whole portfolio does, what's it's expected return and what's at variance. But that's not the way people think. In fact, people have two portfolios often. You have a safe part of your portfolio that you will not risk and you have a risky part that you can have fun with.

Attention anomolies. Psychologists have long understood that you can't pay attention to eerything. You have to decided what to pay attention to. The problem is that too many people watch the stock market every day and if the market moves a lot, they will pay even more attention to it even though a day to day move is irrelevant. There is a social basis for attention and that is that you tend to pay attention to the same things that other people pay attention to. This bias may have evolved for a good reason, but what that means is that there's going to be mispricings in the markets. If everyone is paying attention to some stock, it creates the probability that it will be overpriced.

When it comes to ambiguous investing, we become vulnerable to the attention anomoly. Some stocks get overpriced, and others are just forgotten. Anchoring refers to a tendency in ambiguous situations to allow one's decisions to be affected by some anchor. Stock prices are anchored to past values.

The representative heuristic. People judge things by familiarity to familiar types. The disjunction effect is the inability to make decisions in advance in anticipation of future information. People don't anticipate their emotions later. So they can't work through a decision tree correctly.
