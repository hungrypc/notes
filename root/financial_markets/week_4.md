# Week 4

## Salon - Recessions

An inverted yield curve is a situation in which short term interest rates, like overnight rates or three month rates, are above long term interest rates. That's not the usual situation because long term bonds are riskier because the payout is coming much later. So people generally demand a higher interest rate, and the market will give them a higher interest rate, but sometimes it's inverted. It's been shown statistically that that's a leading indicator of a recession. Historically, inverted yield curves tend to  be followed by recessions.

But why is an inverted yield curve predicting a recession? One thought is that recessions occur when people get pessimistic and they might get pessimistic about 10 years into the future.

The stock market is also a leading indicator of a recession. It's a fundamental fact though that recessions are just hard to forecast.

## History of Mortgage Lending

The idea of collateral is very old, that is, I'll lend you some money but you have to sign a contract saying I can get to sell your land or something if you don't pay me back and take the money out of that. Otherwise, lending couldn't happen. We have it as a verb. To mortgage your house means to offer it as collateral for a load. So when you get a mortgage on your house, typically it is to buy the house, the bank lends you the money to buy the house, but if you stop paying on the mortgage, they can reclaim the house. Maybe not all of it, they'll sell it and take what's owed to them out of it and plus maybe some charges, and then you have the remainder. That's the idea. And mortgage lending is very important because they can lend to anybody, as long as they can value the house. They don't have to really be able to value your trustworthiness to pay the money back. They can count on the house value.

The history of mortgage lending goes back at least to the Tang Dynasty in China. The word mortgage became common in the English language in the late 18th century, though property law wasn't well developed back then because it wasn't even clear who owned property.

In the late 19th century, Germany had something called the "Grundbuch" that would list the for the whole country who owns what. That made it so much better that property inow is clear, title to property is clear (although it's still not completely clear).

## Commercial Real Estate Vehicles

Real estate partnership is an example of a direct participation program. In order to buy in to a real estate partnership, you have to be an accredited investor, which is defined by the SEC as in terms of your wealth and your income. The idea is, we will protect the small investors against fraud and being cheated because they don't have lawyers and can't afford advisors and soo they are vulnerable. But if you're rich, the government says all right, you have your advisors. You have to protect ignorant people, not everyone is smart, we can't let the crazy schemes prey on them.

So a real estate partnership is for accredited investors and a limited partnership means you have limited liabilities.

Direct participation or flow through vehicles, they escape corporate profits tax. But their profits become your income. The IRS has various requirements. One of them is that a DPP can't be perpetual, it has to have a limited life. Corporations derive a lot of their value from the fact that they go on forever. Once a company establishes a reputation, it has value that will last maybe hundreds of years (or if not that long, at least many decades). But a DPP is supposed to be for a particular life. That means, for example, you would buy an apartment building, a typical DPP. You'd get a small number of partners, rich people who buy into your partnership. And then you say that in 20 years we'll sell the building, and then we close down. So you've satisfied the IRS requirements for a pass-through vehicle, and you don't have to take corporate profits tax which is a big advantage.

The general partner runs the business and does not have limited liability. Must own at least 1%. Limited partners are passive incestors, just rich people typically, and they can replace the general partner. And they sell units to investors and give performance based compensation to the general partner who's taking the risks.

Now there were compaints about these, they were trying to protect small investors. But when that left small investors unable to invest in real estate. In 1960, the US Congress created something called a REIT, Real Estate Investment Trust.

So the complaint was, I, a little guy, just can't invest in all of these buildings that have been making so much money for rich people. So the US government created a new kind of investment vehicle called REIT that would be available to small investors, and they'd be regulated to be safe. Bit it wouldn't necessarily be sage, because you're investing in real estate, and if a real estate goes bad. But at least they won't be taken advantage of. And they also get the tax break.

What main problem of DPPs did REITs solve? : DPPs are primarily for wealthy individuals, but REITs are not. REITs were created to allow everybody to invest in real estate.

REITS are getting much bigger. US is the biggest source of REITS. So the law restricts REITs. So they're not going to pay the corporate profits tax, so they don't want to let corporations call themselves a REIT. A company could say, wow, we own real estate, we own the factory and so we're a REIT. No way, you can't call yourself a REIT to escape taces. So they had to define it.

They defined it that

- 75% of the assets must be in real estate or cash
- 75% of the income must come from real estate
- 90% of their income must be from real estate dividend, interest and capital gains, and 95% has to be paid out

Here's where the dividend earnings ratio is set by law. They've gotta pay out their earnings. And also, they wanted to discourage, no more than 30% of the income from sale of properties held for less than four years. They wanted it to be long-term investing, not turning over rapidly.

Starting in 1960s, there was a REIT boom. That was followed by a recession and a drop in proerty prices into the early 70s. There was a second boom after the tax reform of 1986, eliminating many of the advantages of partnerships. It used to be that DPPs could do fancy arithmetic on their taxes that you got, which would make them very advantageous, notably you could depreciate by favourable rules that reduced your taxes even if the depreciation wasn't real. So they made it less profitable in 1986 to invest in a DPP. And then there was a third boom starting in 1992. There's also a time when a lot of specialized REITs developed to appeal to investor interest. So you can buy a golf course REIT.

## Mortgages, part 1

Mortgages owned by households was reecntly $13.8 trillion. 48 million mortgaged homes, that's one for every six or seven people. There are also problems in the mortgage industry. Because in 2012, right after the financial crisis, when the housing market bottomed, there were almost 11 million homes that were under water (which means the value of the home was less than the value of the mortgage). That was one in five homes. What would benefit people who lived in those homes would be to abandon the house. It's called jingle mail. You put your keys in an envelop, and you sign a short letter to the lending bank, I'm outta here. Now that only works legally in what are called non-recourse states. Some states are recourse, they can go after you and try to get your money beyond the house. But many of our states are non recourse, and even if they are they won't actually often go after you because it's too expensive.

But most people don't, most people keep paying. It left our economies in shambles. These people knew they were under water, they know that they had negative savings. The typicaly homeowner, especially younger homeowners, have virtually nothing more than their house. And if that goes under water, that means their personal net worth is negative. So we have 10 million families (something like that) with negative savings. And that's what killed the economy.

So the whole economy went down. In the 1920s and before, there weren't as many mortgages, the industry wasn't as developed. But the mortgages that you got were typically five year term or less. You might get a two year loan, or three year loan to buy a house. Now of course, you're going to live in it more than two or three years. But how do you deal with it? We have to just come back and refinance. The bank says, no problem, we're giving you a two year mortgage to buy a house. In two years come back, and we'll give you a new load at the then prevailing interest rate. The problem was, in the 1930s, we had the Great Depression. And it onvolved a crash in home prices, because everyone was poor. They couldn't pay as much to buy a house anymore. And secondly, it produced 25% unemployment. So now in two years, you bought a house in 1929. It's now 1931, you're underwater. You go back to the bank and say, I'd like to renew my mortgage. The bank would say no way. You don't have a job, your house isn't worth as much as the mortgage. So they would foreclose on you. So millions of houses were foreclosed in the early 1930s. That lead to the Roosevelt administration. They created the federal housing administration in 1934, that would ensure mortgages. That is insure the bank against your default. So the government was taking on the risk that had formerly been on homeowners. Roosevelt took a big gamble. He said, we're going to just insure them, and if there's further defaults and further crashes, we're going to take it our of taxpayers, and we're going to pay you off.

So the banks started lending again, and it brought the housing market back up. The other thing that Roosevelt did in 1934 was to require 15 year loans. Any FHA had to be 15 years until maturity or longer. That's established a trend toward long term mortgages. As time went on, it became standard in the US to have long term mortgages. And now, typically, it's 30 years.

## Mortgages, part 2

The 30 year mortgage rate tracks the 10 year government bond yield. This is a pretty good relationship. The reason that there's a good relationship is that there should be one interest rate.

30 year mortgage, that looks very different from tenure. But most mortgages are paid off in less than 30 years. In fact, this is the way it works. The typical homeowner buys a first home which we call a starter home, when they're in their 20s maybe. And then their jobs tend to be unstable at that. They're moving from one job to another, and they might move several times in the space of 10 years, and then typically, the normal life cycle in an advanced country is by the time you reach 40 or thereabouts, you've now settled down in a job that will keep you for 30 years. Not always but typically. And then when you buy a house which is your final house, which you live in for 30, 40 years. And then you end up moving to some kind of retirement community, and then you move to a nursing home, and then you move to the cemetery. That's the life cycle. But look at the housing purchases there. There's a lot fo short purchases. And then there's a long one. But we give these people 30 year mortgages even if they're buying a starter home. They never know it's a start home. They don't like to bring that up, you're buying a home. So the average time other mortgage actually is outstanding is something like 10 years. Even though it's a 30 year mortgage. So they like to track, they're doing this deliberately. They're tracking the 10 year mortgage rate.

Why is there a spread though? The bank is charging more than the 10 year rate. Home mortgages are slighly risky. Some of them are FHA insured. So there's other mortgage insurance, but they have to pay for that. Also, a mortgage has to be serviced. You have to send out letters. You have to maintain a system. When people don't pay, you have to call a credit bureau that will nudge them to pay. So all those are costs.

High inflation and high nominal rate periods bring in high mortgage. It makes it difficult to buy a house.

Which of the following is a reason that the 30 year mortgage rate is higher than the 10 year treasury bond YTM: there are overhead costs to managing a mortgage.

But there are other kinds of mortgages. What was prompted by your question is the so-called price level adjusted mortgage (PLAM), which they made the amortization actually negative. Amortization means, paying off the principal. Your payment comes in two parts. One of them is interest, one of them is amortization. So PLAMs started to come in this really high inflation period. PLAMs don't exist anymore.

A home equity loan is a loan on the value of your house that you might take on later as a way of getting money. So for example, for home improvements or you might just take out a second mortgage, and they're often marketed separately. And they were part of what got us into a great abount of debt just prior to the financial crisis because people were first of all, borrowing at a conventional fixed rate mortgage. So people started borrowing more and more against their house. We had fewer people who had paid off their houses and more and more debtors. And then the financial crisis came.

## PMI, CMOs, CDOs

> PMI: Private Mortgage Insurance
> CMO: Collateralized Mortgage Obligation
> CDO:

In 1934, the US decided to insure mortgages of a certain kind through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and later through the Veterans Administration for veterans. Gov would tell the mortgage lender that if this guy defaults, it will pay up so don't worry. These people wanted to make sure that people who fought in the war and came home wouldn't be handicapped by their being out of the business world. Veterans should get some special preference but private companies also did insurance on mortgages. So when you get your first house, you'll have a mortgage payment that subsumes the PMI. And that ensures the lender but you have to pay for the insurance. You the homeowner, pay for it. If the down payment is less than 20% of the value of the home, and it usually is. There's a controversy though. It's more of a failure to notify you. You would think that the mortgage lender/insurance company would notify you when the value of your house went up. So now, your mortgage balance is less than 80% of the home value and tell you to cancel, but they don't. Many people continue to pay for PMI long after it was necessary. So insurance companies are not necessarily reliable.

When a bank issues a mortgage, it's a load so it's a piece of paper with a certain value, they can sell the mortgage to someone else and typically continue as the servicer of the mortgage namely, you send your mortgage check to them and if you don't pay, you get a call from them or from someone they subcontract to call you. But the owner of the mortgage is different, now it's an investor. A CMO is a pool of mortgages that is sold to investors like you, you could invest in one of these. But they also divide them up into tranche. The senior tranche gets paid first. If there are defaults, it affects the senior tranche only if all the other tranches have been wiped out. So they might have a AAA tranche, then a AA tranche and so on that are not rated as highly. And it helps them sell these securities because many investors are required by their charter or their sense of obligation to invest only in AAA things. So CMOs - an ordinary of securitized mortgages would not have a AAA rating, because the homeowners might default. But if you divide them up into tranches like that, you can get AAA securities out of them. The last tranche, the worst one is called toxic waste. And these are the ones probably not worth anything or very likely not worth anything. And hedge fund investors might buy those if they are at a really low price so they take all the risk. But presumable they understand it better than you, the investor.

So what is a CDO? It's something like that, does the same thing, it divides it up into tranches. You might think of CDO as just a more general category. they don't have to buy just home mortgages, they can buy auto loans or any kind of debt.

## Post Crisis Regulation

After the financial crisis, people were really angry that the CMO and CDO people had repackaged mortgages and sold them to the general public. And that the banks who sold the mortgages didn't really care whether they were good or not. Because they weren't going to own them. If you'r in the mortgage origination business, you're a banker that makes mortgage loans, and you know you're going to resell it to some ignorant investor, then you say, what's the point? I'll approve everybody, I'll make maximum amount of money. So this was the period when, among other things, the liar's load occurred up here. A liar's loan was a mortgage issued to a person who did not show evidence of having a job or having a good record. They just took the guy on faith. So in Europe, the European Parliament passed a rule that a mortgage originator must hold 5% of the mortgages that it initiates. So if you're a bank and you issue mortgages, you can't sell the last 5%. That gives you an incentive to stay above level and not to give liar's loans.

In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act copied this idea, but it said that we won't require that if the mortgages are qualified residential mortgages. The term qualified  residential mortgage was defined by the act, but didn't fully define it. It said our appropriate regulators will have to come up with the definition of a qualified residential mortgage, which is a mortgage that is where all the right things have been done by the originator, the lender, to assure that it won't default.

So the Dodd-Frank Act said that you, as a mortgage originator, have to hold 5% of the mortgages you issue, or more, unless it's a qualified residential mortgage as will be defined in due course. So they left it to the regulators to say you have to define what is a qualified residential mortgage. And that means a mortgage that has been done properly, so that we can be reasonably assured that the homeowner that won't default.

When they brought this up, every banker in the country wrote a complaining letter. So it took them 4 years to come up with the definition. Originally they ahd a 20% down payment requirement. They've dropped it.

Now incidentally, you don't have to adhere to these rules, but you can't sell call of the mortgages if you don't. And so bankers pretty much are all going to follow these rules because they don't want to be stuck with something that can't be sold. Bankers have to sell the mortgages to get money to make new mortgages, they're in the mortgage origination business. And mortgages are inherentyly not held by banks, somewhat by banks, but often not. So they just generally want to qualify.

So that means you have to have equal payments, or substantially. You can't have no payments at the beginning and then payments later, because that would be attracting borrowers who don't have the money.

A balloon payment is a payment at the end. They can't have a payment at the end, it's gotta be an annuity.

In other countries, they'll say you can't load more than 90% of the value of the house. QRM rules don't have that. Instead, they have a debt to income ratio. That is, you cannot have a debt which is more than 43% of the borrowers income.

## Chalk Talk - Excess Reserves

> Excess reserves are the reserves that banks hold beyond what they're required to hold by regulation

It's an interesting chart. They never did hold any excess. Why don't they want to hold exccess? Because they didn't pay any interest. And so banks like to lend out the money. But then, suddenly, they started holdinge excess reserves. Why is that?

Simple, the Great Recession. It was so bad that in many countries all over the world, Central Banks cut interest rates as far as they could, and that was zero in order to stimulate the economy. So the problem is, now, banks don't care. They can only invest at zero. The banks have no place to go with this money, so they think, why don't we just leave it in reserves? We don't care, so we're holding much more reserve than the Central Bank requires. They were holding millions of dollars. It's really remarkable that there's so much cash just lying around now and not being lent out. And interest rates have come up a little bit. This chart ends but they're so close to zero anyway that banks don't see lending opportunites that appeal to them. Also, regulation has made it harder for them to make risky loans.

So this is the source of our concerns about what's called secular stagnation. There's something different about now, compared to any other time. What's differnt is, there's just no place to invest. You wouldn't leave money lying around, earning zero interest. There are progessional finance people running banks, and they're letting it just lie there, earning nothing. So it's a sign of some kind of fundamental weakness in the world economu, that came on with the financial crisis. Moral hazard and adverse selection are fundamental issues.

Let's put it in the context of fire insurance. If you open up a company that insures home against burning down, you run two risks. One of them is moral hazard, that's the risk that you sold the policy to someone who owns a house to insure that house against fire. Then, the person deliberately burns the house down in order to collect. So the protection against that kind of moral hazard is, don't insure the full value of the house. Make it always in the interest of the home buyer to sell the house rather than burn it down. The other thing is adverse selection. If you're doing fire insurance, even if people are moral and ethical, and they won't play tricks on you, it could be that people might konw that their house is not fire proof. So all the people will flock to you who have homes that are in danger of burning down. And so, you will get a selected part of the potential insurance market. You have to carefully examine the kinds of property and you'll get a fire expert to look and see whether this house is different from others.

How do we relate this to excess reserves? Some people will say when they look at the chart, that all this money is sitting in the bank's reserves not earning any interest. But then I say, I look around, I can see interest rates that are higher than that. That are higher than zero, like for example junk bonds. They might pay an interest of 10%, even now. So what's going on here? This coould be considered adverse selection. At this time in history when interst rates are practically zero, and you you go out and say, no, I'm going to invest in high interest rate loans. You might be suffering an adverse selection problem. You might be suffering the problem that some of these borrowers are going to burn their house down or they're very subject to fires or disasters. And so you will always see what looks like investment opportunities, but for professional bankers, they're not opportunities. You can as a bank advertise, we're making loans at a good interest rate. Who's going to come to you? If business is bad, it's going to be people who are not good prospects.

So what you need is a business that invests in information and trusting relationships. So a well run bank will have local offices in every city. The local banker then gets involved with people in that city. And bankers then use their gut intuition and their information to decide whether to make loans, or whether to take risks.

## The Bubble

Most people would think, as the population grows and the economy grows, homes would keep going up in price. There is some truth to that, we have limited land, and people especially like to live in established cities where they have jobs. But offsetting that is that our technology for building homes is getting better and so we can mass produce things more and we can build them more efficiently. So we don't need to do all the expensive things to maintain a home. Building costs have been falling. The building cost might go up because of labor costs, but labor is only part of building. And the price of land is actually a rather small component of home prices. Structures depreciate and wear out and they go out of fashion. In fact, they will tear these houses down sometimes when they buy and put up a completely new house. So home prices don't tend to go up. But somehow in this period in the 90s and early 2000s, home prices were just seen as always going up. It had something to do with the culture with the story about the emerging world. About the rich Chinese or Russians that were coming in and buying out properties, they got exaggerated and so it lead to a bubble. (Interesting to note that this was a comment from mid 2010s, where now in the 2020s we see that the story is really true and not just speculation).

On a survey asking people whether they agreed that real estate is the best investment for long-term holders who can buy and sell through the ups and downs of the market, it's shown that when home prices have been going up, agreement to this statement also goes up, and when home prices start going down, they start losing their agreement. So this is evidence of a bubble.

Now, the housing sector has a big impact on the economy. Through residential investment. Residential investment in the GDP accounts, consists of building of new houses, new apartment buildings, and improvements/additions to houses and apartment buildings.

The biggest boom ever was in the 1990s until 2006 in home prices. And then suddenly the home prices collapsed. Housing starts went down by 80%. And then they recovered dramatically, and so did home prices.

What happened to new housing projects in 2007? : They had been increasing dramatically and then suddenly fell to a record low when the price of homes collapsed. Low home prices disincentivized new housing projects.

Why did this turning point happen? Why did everyone seem to believe and then suddenly not? Public attitudes were changing around 2005. The Economist magazine wrote "Perhaps the best evidence that America's house prices have reached dangerous levels is the fact that house-buying mania has been  plastered on the front of virtually every American newspaper and magazine over the past month". They noticed that everyone was talking about crazed homebuyers. Time magazine also wrote something similar.

## Regulation Overview

So regulation is substantially aimed at dealing with human problems and with manipulation and deception. It's not that people are bad, it's that people are constrained by the market. If everyone else is doing something, you have to do it too, or you won't stay in business. This is what we call the Phishing Equilibrium.

So we need regulation. One thing we need to do is distinguish between microprudential and macroprudential regulation.
> Microprudential is regulation to protect individuals from abuse.
> Macroprudential is regulation to help prevent big crisis that affects the economy.

Regulators are not just there to protect you as a stockholder/consumer, it's to protect the whole economy.

When you bring up regulation, there will always be some business people who will oppose it. Namely the business people whose interests are harmed by the regulation. But on the other hand, business people want regulation because they don't want to live in a system that forces them to do corrupt things, or to do things thar are not in the public interest. They would rather compete in an environment that encourages good behavior.

## Salon - Regulation and Housing

What regulations has the Dodd-Frank Act put in place to prevent the financial crisis from happening again?

The act set in motion a lot of regulatory rule that is supposed to prevent that from happening again. The rule puts specific requirements on mortgages that are qualified, namely QRMs, mortgages that are not subject to the five percent retention rule. And the rules specify that the debt payments, your monthly debt payments, cannot be more than 43% of your monthly income.

They also have to verify that you have a job, what your total debt payments are. So it's going to be harder, and that should keep prices more under control. At least you won't be able to borrow to build these prices up.

Maybe government should defend the price of the stock market if it's in a free fall panic. They tend to do that. The problem is that the public starts to expect the government to do that, and then they lose their sense of connection to reality. This is especially true in China. There have been big drops in home prices at certain times, and people get very upset. People get angry and they protest to their local government. This has lead to some pressure being put on firms to try to keep the price up. And so it leads again to public expectations that prices can never fall. This is a factor in a number of countries. They think that real estate is such a fundamental right of citizens and that a comptent government will never let the price fall.

Robert thinks that the purpose of creating a tax benefit to homeowndership is to encourage homeownership because it's long been a theory that homeowners are better citizens.

## Within Firm Regulation

Five levels of Financial Regulation:

1. Within-firm Regulation
2. Trade Groups
3. Local Gov Regulation
4. National Gov Regulation
5. 5. International Regulation

Let's start with within-firm.

The board of directors is a uniform policy practically everywhere in the world. They typically have ourside directors, people from other walks of life who come in to represent the community, or to just give them a sense of perspective. The board of directors hires the president and fires the president if he or she is not acting properly. You want people who are connected to the world, and you value that, so you can't ask them to make being part of the a board of directors a full-time job. So a board of directors is usually a part-time job, and they're out there involved in different things.

So you put peope in with reputations. When you're appointing directors, you don't appoint people who have any shade of suspicion of having a personality disorder. That's part of what makes directors work. It's people that there's relative agreement that are not criminals, not liars, and have some sense of community spirit. A problem with companies is we put people on the corporation or board of directors who have such good reputations that they're not going to compromise it. Because if you have a reputation, it's precious. And that's what partly what prevents devious tricks from being played. (why is this a problem? he doesn't explain.)

The word tunneling is often used to describe tricks that people in companies use to steal money from the company.

US has Common law, which means that they have legislators making laws, but they also have courts making laws in a different environment. Their laws are not public laws officially, but they're legal precedent. Common law has an advantage in that the courts are making judgement in a specific case where there's a dispute. So that makes them really close to the problem and really close to human issues. Common law is better than civil law, because it has this aspect to it, and it's better able to deal with tunnelling.

So how do you achieve tunnelling? You gotta disguise it in business complexities so that when someone sues you, it gets all into a quagmire that they can't figure out what you did.

## Trade Groups

One example of a trade group is the stock exchange. The first stock exchange in the US was founded in 1792, and they signed an agreement (Buttonwood Agreement) that says "We, the subscribers, brokers for the purchase and sale of public stock, do hereby solemnly promise and pledge ourselves to each other that we will not buy or sell from this day for any person whatsoever any kind of public stock, at a less rate than one-quarter of one percent commission on the specie value, and that we will give preference to each other in our negotiations." It basically is a price-fixing agreement. They don't want to compete with each other, and in order to prevent someone undercutting them. They also promised not to trade with any other broker that doesn't sign this agreement. It's collusion as we'd call it.

So the NY stock exchange was a monopoly, it was enforcing commission. The commission is hat you pay for the service of having your shares sold or being able to buy a share through a broker. So, the US finally outlawed fixed commissions, it took until 1975, long after 1792.

## Local Regulation

So the US started out as a confederation of individual states, and financial regulation was mostly local, but I'm calling a state a local government. They had two banks of the US. One created in the 1790s called the Bank of the United States. It was a central bank of sorts but it didn't conduct monetary policy. But id expired, according to the original legislation, after 20 years and they renewed it in 1816 with what was called the Second Bank of the United States, which also had a 20 year charter and it expired in 1836. After that there was really no central government regulation of financial activities. Until the National Banking Act of 1863 under President Lincoln during the Civil War, which created a system of national banks that were regulated by the federal government instead of the state government.

So a lot of cities then started setting up, starting right after the legislation, with national banks that had a national bank charter, so they weren't regulated by the local state government. And some of them listed their name as First National Bank of whatever city, meaning they were created right after the act.

But even so, then still most of the regulation was in the state governments. The big change came in 1934 when the federal government set up the Securities and Exchange Commission.

At this point the securities law passed substantially to the central government, there has been a trend toward centralization. However, corporate law is still held by the state government.

It was partly inspired by the observation that there was a lot of shenanigans being played in the financial sector. Before the SEC there was some expansion of regulation in what was called the progressive era in the US. That was the first 20 years or so of the 20th century, and a lot of states created what were called Blue Sky Laws, which were laws regulating tricks and deception in financial markets.

There was a lot fo fraud and deception in the 1920s brought on perhaps by the telephone, which made it possible for people to make cold calls with financial deals offered to the general public. They could easily get away, because the person never met the person on the other side of the phone call. The first blue sky laws was in Kansas in 1911, and it became a model for other states. They virtually all established blue sky laws, which typically required the registration and regulated the offering and sale of securities.

After the sense that you can't regulate financial activies at the local government level, because they they spread across state borders, the SEC was set up in 1934. It was highly opposed by many people in the business community, thinking that it was usurpation of powers. The Constitution grants to the states anything not enumerated in the Constitution as federal, and the Constitution doesn't mention financial regulation. But somehow they passed the Supreme Court as constitutional.

The critical thing is that the SEC following Lous Brandeis, emphasized disclosure. "If you force people to cmoe out with all the details of what they're doing, that will expose manipulations and fraud". So the idea of the SEC was to require security issuers to submit standardized forms/statements of what they're doing, and public corporations to put up for public view, balance sheets and profit and loss statements regularly.

William O Douglas, Yale professor, was a leader at that time of what was called the "Legal Realist Movement". It's something like the behaviour economics revolution that came much later, but this is a revolution in law schools. So this was a law school movement, which Robert thinks enhanced the law enormously, recognizing human limitations. That there was too much of putting in legal documents, things in fine print, that you know nobody is going to figure out. So, the idea is that you have to force companies, or ginancial institutions to put it out in clear and consistent standardized way.

So, one thing that happened in regulation was, some of the regulation was captured. The regulators until 1975, allowed stock exchanges to fix cmmissions that brokers would charge. All these guys were into fixing commissions to make a good amount of money, but that was anti-competetive.

Another major thing that the SEC did was to define the distinction between public and private securities. Public securities are securities that the SEC has approved for general public investment. And it had to go through an approval process through the SEC. If you want to be listed, your company shares to be listed on the stock exchange, you have to get approved. You have to make the appropriate filings and get approval as a public company on the SEC, and then you have to make these quarterly filings that appear on the Edgar database.

Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the procedure of going public. It means all companies start as private companies, but there's a point in the life of a company when they do an IPO, which means they issue stock to the public. Companies can also go private. That is a public company may not want to stay public. Why  wouldn't they? They might have secrets, and they feel that their business is threatened by that. For example, it's easier for someone to take them over if they're a public company. So, sometimes companies are taken private through a procedure, again which the SEC recognizes.

Hedge funds are examples of companies that are private. They are for wealthy investors only. You have to circumvent the SEC rulings as an investment company, if you want to do certain things like charge high commission, or high salaries for your leaders.
