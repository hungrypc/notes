# Week 4

## Salon - Recessions

An inverted yield curve is a situation in which short term interest rates, like overnight rates or three month rates, are above long term interest rates. That's not the usual situation because long term bonds are riskier because the payout is coming much later. So people generally demand a higher interest rate, and the market will give them a higher interest rate, but sometimes it's inverted. It's been shown statistically that that's a leading indicator of a recession. Historically, inverted yield curves tend to  be followed by recessions.

But why is an inverted yield curve predicting a recession? One thought is that recessions occur when people get pessimistic and they might get pessimistic about 10 years into the future.

The stock market is also a leading indicator of a recession. It's a fundamental fact though that recessions are just hard to forecast.

## History of Mortgage Lending

The idea of collateral is very old, that is, I'll lend you some money but you have to sign a contract saying I can get to sell your land or something if you don't pay me back and take the money out of that. Otherwise, lending couldn't happen. We have it as a verb. To mortgage your house means to offer it as collateral for a load. So when you get a mortgage on your house, typically it is to buy the house, the bank lends you the money to buy the house, but if you stop paying on the mortgage, they can reclaim the house. Maybe not all of it, they'll sell it and take what's owed to them out of it and plus maybe some charges, and then you have the remainder. That's the idea. And mortgage lending is very important because they can lend to anybody, as long as they can value the house. They don't have to really be able to value your trustworthiness to pay the money back. They can count on the house value.

The history of mortgage lending goes back at least to the Tang Dynasty in China. The word mortgage became common in the English language in the late 18th century, though property law wasn't well developed back then because it wasn't even clear who owned property.

In the late 19th century, Germany had something called the "Grundbuch" that would list the for the whole country who owns what. That made it so much better that property inow is clear, title to property is clear (although it's still not completely clear).

## Commercial Real Estate Vehicles

Real estate partnership is an example of a direct participation program. In order to buy in to a real estate partnership, you have to be an accredited investor, which is defined by the SEC as in terms of your wealth and your income. The idea is, we will protect the small investors against fraud and being cheated because they don't have lawyers and can't afford advisors and soo they are vulnerable. But if you're rich, the government says all right, you have your advisors. You have to protect ignorant people, not everyone is smart, we can't let the crazy schemes prey on them.

So a real estate partnership is for accredited investors and a limited partnership means you have limited liabilities.

Direct participation or flow through vehicles, they escape corporate profits tax. But their profits become your income. The IRS has various requirements. One of them is that a DPP can't be perpetual, it has to have a limited life. Corporations derive a lot of their value from the fact that they go on forever. Once a company establishes a reputation, it has value that will last maybe hundreds of years (or if not that long, at least many decades). But a DPP is supposed to be for a particular life. That means, for example, you would buy an apartment building, a typical DPP. You'd get a small number of partners, rich people who buy into your partnership. And then you say that in 20 years we'll sell the building, and then we close down. So you've satisfied the IRS requirements for a pass-through vehicle, and you don't have to take corporate profits tax which is a big advantage.

The general partner runs the business and does not have limited liability. Must own at least 1%. Limited partners are passive incestors, just rich people typically, and they can replace the general partner. And they sell units to investors and give performance based compensation to the general partner who's taking the risks.

Now there were compaints about these, they were trying to protect small investors. But when that left small investors unable to invest in real estate. In 1960, the US Congress created something called a REIT, Real Estate Investment Trust.

So the complaint was, I, a little guy, just can't invest in all of these buildings that have been making so much money for rich people. So the US government created a new kind of investment vehicle called REIT that would be available to small investors, and they'd be regulated to be safe. Bit it wouldn't necessarily be sage, because you're investing in real estate, and if a real estate goes bad. But at least they won't be taken advantage of. And they also get the tax break.

What main problem of DPPs did REITs solve? : DPPs are primarily for wealthy individuals, but REITs are not. REITs were created to allow everybody to invest in real estate.

REITS are getting much bigger. US is the biggest source of REITS. So the law restricts REITs. So they're not going to pay the corporate profits tax, so they don't want to let corporations call themselves a REIT. A company could say, wow, we own real estate, we own the factory and so we're a REIT. No way, you can't call yourself a REIT to escape taces. So they had to define it.

They defined it that

- 75% of the assets must be in real estate or cash
- 75% of the income must come from real estate
- 90% of their income must be from real estate dividend, interest and capital gains, and 95% has to be paid out

Here's where the dividend earnings ratio is set by law. They've gotta pay out their earnings. And also, they wanted to discourage, no more than 30% of the income from sale of properties held for less than four years. They wanted it to be long-term investing, not turning over rapidly.

Starting in 1960s, there was a REIT boom. That was followed by a recession and a drop in proerty prices into the early 70s. There was a second boom after the tax reform of 1986, eliminating many of the advantages of partnerships. It used to be that DPPs could do fancy arithmetic on their taxes that you got, which would make them very advantageous, notably you could depreciate by favourable rules that reduced your taxes even if the depreciation wasn't real. So they made it less profitable in 1986 to invest in a DPP. And then there was a third boom starting in 1992. There's also a time when a lot of specialized REITs developed to appeal to investor interest. So you can buy a golf course REIT.

## Mortgages, part 1

Mortgages owned by households was reecntly $13.8 trillion. 48 million mortgaged homes, that's one for every six or seven people. There are also problems in the mortgage industry. Because in 2012, right after the financial crisis, when the housing market bottomed, there were almost 11 million homes that were under water (which means the value of the home was less than the value of the mortgage). That was one in five homes. What would benefit people who lived in those homes would be to abandon the house. It's called jingle mail. You put your keys in an envelop, and you sign a short letter to the lending bank, I'm outta here. Now that only works legally in what are called non-recourse states. Some states are recourse, they can go after you and try to get your money beyond the house. But many of our states are non recourse, and even if they are they won't actually often go after you because it's too expensive.

But most people don't, most people keep paying. It left our economies in shambles. These people knew they were under water, they know that they had negative savings. The typicaly homeowner, especially younger homeowners, have virtually nothing more than their house. And if that goes under water, that means their personal net worth is negative. So we have 10 million families (something like that) with negative savings. And that's what killed the economy.

So the whole economy went down. In the 1920s and before, there weren't as many mortgages, the industry wasn't as developed. But the mortgages that you got were typically five year term or less. You might get a two year loan, or three year loan to buy a house. Now of course, you're going to live in it more than two or three years. But how do you deal with it? We have to just come back and refinance. The bank says, no problem, we're giving you a two year mortgage to buy a house. In two years come back, and we'll give you a new load at the then prevailing interest rate. The problem was, in the 1930s, we had the Great Depression. And it onvolved a crash in home prices, because everyone was poor. They couldn't pay as much to buy a house anymore. And secondly, it produced 25% unemployment. So now in two years, you bought a house in 1929. It's now 1931, you're underwater. You go back to the bank and say, I'd like to renew my mortgage. The bank would say no way. You don't have a job, your house isn't worth as much as the mortgage. So they would foreclose on you. So millions of houses were foreclosed in the early 1930s. That lead to the Roosevelt administration. They created the federal housing administration in 1934, that would ensure mortgages. That is insure the bank against your default. So the government was taking on the risk that had formerly been on homeowners. Roosevelt took a big gamble. He said, we're going to just insure them, and if there's further defaults and further crashes, we're going to take it our of taxpayers, and we're going to pay you off.

So the banks started lending again, and it brought the housing market back up. The other thing that Roosevelt did in 1934 was to require 15 year loans. Any FHA had to be 15 years until maturity or longer. That's established a trend toward long term mortgages. As time went on, it became standard in the US to have long term mortgages. And now, typically, it's 30 years.

## Mortgages, part 2

The 30 year mortgage rate tracks the 10 year government bond yield. This is a pretty good relationship. The reason that there's a good relationship is that there should be one interest rate.

30 year mortgage, that looks very different from tenure. But most mortgages are paid off in less than 30 years. In fact, this is the way it works. The typical homeowner buys a first home which we call a starter home, when they're in their 20s maybe. And then their jobs tend to be unstable at that. They're moving from one job to another, and they might move several times in the space of 10 years, and then typically, the normal life cycle in an advanced country is by the time you reach 40 or thereabouts, you've now settled down in a job that will keep you for 30 years. Not always but typically. And then when you buy a house which is your final house, which you live in for 30, 40 years. And then you end up moving to some kind of retirement community, and then you move to a nursing home, and then you move to the cemetery. That's the life cycle. But look at the housing purchases there. There's a lot fo short purchases. And then there's a long one. But we give these people 30 year mortgages even if they're buying a starter home. They never know it's a start home. They don't like to bring that up, you're buying a home. So the average time other mortgage actually is outstanding is something like 10 years. Even though it's a 30 year mortgage. So they like to track, they're doing this deliberately. They're tracking the 10 year mortgage rate.

Why is there a spread though? The bank is charging more than the 10 year rate. Home mortgages are slighly risky. Some of them are FHA insured. So there's other mortgage insurance, but they have to pay for that. Also, a mortgage has to be serviced. You have to send out letters. You have to maintain a system. When people don't pay, you have to call a credit bureau that will nudge them to pay. So all those are costs.

High inflation and high nominal rate periods bring in high mortgage. It makes it difficult to buy a house.

Which of the following is a reason that the 30 year mortgage rate is higher than the 10 year treasury bond YTM: there are overhead costs to managing a mortgage.

But there are other kinds of mortgages. What was prompted by your question is the so-called price level adjusted mortgage (PLAM), which they made the amortization actually negative. Amortization means, paying off the principal. Your payment comes in two parts. One of them is interest, one of them is amortization. So PLAMs started to come in this really high inflation period. PLAMs don't exist anymore.

A home equity loan is a loan on the value of your house that you might take on later as a way of getting money. So for example, for home improvements or you might just take out a second mortgage, and they're often marketed separately. And they were part of what got us into a great abount of debt just prior to the financial crisis because people were first of all, borrowing at a conventional fixed rate mortgage. So people started borrowing more and more against their house. We had fewer people who had paid off their houses and more and more debtors. And then the financial crisis came.
